# Minimal embedded dependency profile

Applications that own their own ingress can depend on Oscope's embedded
lifecycle without acquiring the loopback server or viewer libraries. Use the
same repository coordinate with `:deps/root "profiles/embedded"`:

```clojure
{:deps
 {io.github.chucklehead-dev/oscope-embedded
  {:git/url "https://github.com/chucklehead-dev/oscope.git"
   :git/sha "<reviewed Oscope revision>"
   :deps/root "profiles/embedded"}}}
```

The profile exposes the canonical `oscope.embedded` and
`oscope.embedded.query` implementations from `src`. It depends only on OTel,
jolt-chDB, jolt-otel-clickhouse, Malli, and data.json. It does not add
jolt-http or jolt-otel-viewer, start a listener, or provide a second lifecycle
implementation. A consumer's direct dependency selections still have normal
precedence; this profile is not an override mechanism.

The checked-in `test/fixtures/minimal-embedded-app` fixture resolves the
profile and asserts the exact dependency revisions. Its application coordinate
selects converged `casselc/db` `96324713` under the canonical `jolt-lang/db`
key. In one fresh Jolt process it opens a real SQLite file for authoritative
application state and a real local-POSIX Durable chDB writer for telemetry,
installs an approved typed span manifest, starts one SDK owner, emits and
flushes one span through the real chDB exporter, and reads that span back
through a bounded typed query. Shutdown retires the query before the Oscope
source, checkpoints and closes Durable, shuts down the SDK terminal action
once, and closes SQLite. Repeated query and embedded stop calls prove that the
underlying terminal actions are idempotent; post-close queries prove both
database handles are retired.

The fixture loads neither `oscope.server` nor `oscope.embedded.viewer`. The
profile still supplies no listener or viewer dependency, and this acceptance
does not exercise remote OTLP or Samizdat HTTP behavior.

Run its focused graph and lifecycle qualification with:

```sh
env JOLT_CHDB_LIB=/path/to/chdb-26.7.3/libchdb.so \
    JOLT_BIN=/path/to/jolt-containing-strict-utf8-and-append-range-fixes \
    jolt -M:test-embedded-profile
```

The outer test runner may remain the project's baseline Jolt, but `JOLT_BIN`
must select the qualified runtime used by the fresh native fixture process.
Hosted CI pins that runtime to public `casselc/jolt` `2d39e854` and installs
the profile's checksum-pinned Linux x86-64 chDB 26.7.3 asset before running the
aggregate. This slice does not claim macOS behavioral qualification.

## Samizdat qualification boundary

The original dependency audit was pinned to casselc/samizdat
`22be90ddf9b05ba8406d6ec231d2748a4da22d8e`. Its application-side versions
included:

- `jolt-lang/http-client` `ccce992d6e3d0035a5ffd1d4364cdb39df4af2f0`;
- `jolt-lang/db` `d85f391ca521da389b935c38f3d78b30eaa23208`;
- Malli 0.17.0; and
- upstream data.json `94463ffb54482427fd9b31f264b06bff6dcfd557`.

That audited Samizdat revision still points the `jolt-lang/db` key at the
`jolt-lang/db` repository. Samizdat itself must repoint that same key to the
merged `casselc/db` repository before combining its authoritative SQLite state
with this Durable profile. The fixture below models that required migration;
it is not the as-pinned `22be90d` graph. The runnable minimal application uses
the same canonical-key repoint for its real SQLite-plus-Durable process.

The current embedded profile selects OTel
`0c50b0f8254713ce9df8a3f201f345b1854000b8`, jolt-chDB
`3552a2575a96e3c9dd7b495a9b16b1e9c3317eee`, and jolt-otel-clickhouse
`14a2998a27f64a9bff329811461be9157a00c849`. OTel's provider-convergence merge
contains the interruptible upstream HTTP behavior in the integrated
`casselc/http-client` revision
`eab6b78d5957f88690faf6768360572a3f185341`. Its documented consumer migration
must be applied by Samizdat itself because dependency aliases do not propagate.

The provider lineage needed by the modeled graph is converged. jolt-chDB's
merged main revision uses
the canonical `jolt-lang/db` key at reviewed provider `6db79163`. The updated
`test/fixtures/samizdat-converged-db-graph` models Samizdat's required repoint
to merged `casselc/db` main `96324713` under that same key. Qualification uses
the resolved local git checkout to verify that `96324713` descends from
`6db79163`. Actual `jolt -Spath` resolution then proves that the authoritative
`db/sqlite.clj` surface and Durable chDB coexist with exactly one physical
`db/**` source root.
The separate `samizdat-pre-convergence-db-graph` fixture pins the old
`jolt-chDB@dbc2db22` dependency (which brings
`io.github.casselc/db@a5bf25d9`) beside `jolt-lang/db@d85f391c` as a causal red
control and proves that graph has two provider roots.

This requalification does not migrate Samizdat's HTTP coordinate or qualify
the remote-stall/Langfuse path. The converged-DB fixture intentionally
continues to observe both pre-migration HTTP roots as a tripwire so that
residual work is not mistaken for part of the database result.

## Durable status boundary

`oscope.embedded/status` remains version 1 and reports Durable freshness and
the last successful persistence boundary as `:unavailable`. This slice does
not adopt or expose a Durable freshness/status capability, and it does not
pin an unpublished status branch or infer freshness from an open connection.
