# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Qualify the Durable collector against jolt-chdb's owned worker and heartbeat
  threads, and require its woven lifecycle trace to renew before release.
- Add `oscope.embedded.query`, a bounded background query facade that keeps
  blocking chDB/JDBC work off Jolt UI fibers and joins its owned OS thread
  before a shared embedded source can be retired.
